Hello, I'm Farouk

<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ufahmad"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I'm Umar Farouk Ahmad, a cybersecurity analyst focused on SOC operations, threat detection, and hands-on defensive security work. I graduated with a degree in Computer Information Systems and built a strong foundation in IT support, system administration, and core security principles.

Over time, I shifted fully into blue teaming — building SOC labs, integrating SIEM/IDS tools, automating detection workflows, and running real investigations. I learn best by doing, so most of the projects here are practical simulations that reflect real SOC tasks.

With CompTIA Security+, ISC2 CC, and EC-Council CSA training, I’m now sharpening my skills as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst through continuous labbing and threat analysis.

🎯 Objective

To grow as a SOC Analyst by applying my technical experience, detection skills, and structured approach to incident response. My long-term focus is defensive security, threat hunting, and using automation and AI to improve security operations.
