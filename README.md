Hello, I'm Farouk

<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ufahmad"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I'm Umar Farouk Ahmad, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and recent graduate in Computer Information Systems. I have a strong background in IT Support, system administration, and security fundamentals. Over the years, I’ve transitioned my curiosity into practical experience by building hands-on SOC labs, automating detection workflows, and integrating security tools into realistic simulations.

With certifications in CompTIA Security+ and ISC2, I’m now focused on growing as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst (Tier 1) — mastering detection, response, and continuous learning through labbing and experimentation.

🎯 Objective

To transition fully into cybersecurity by combining my technical experience, passion for analysis, and growing skill set in SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response. My ultimate goal is to contribute to defensive security operations while continuously exploring automation and AI-driven security enhancement.
