Wireshark Traffic Analysis — What you should focus on
1. Start broad, then narrow

Always begin with:

Protocol filters (tcp, udp, arp, icmp, dns, http)

Then add behavior-based filters

2. Recognize common attack patterns (this is the real skill)
🔍 Nmap scans

TCP Connect scan

tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size > 1024


SYN scan

tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size <= 1024


UDP scan

icmp.type==3 and icmp.code==3


👉 Look for volume + repetition, not single packets.

🧪 ARP poisoning / MITM

Red flags:

Same IP → multiple MAC addresses

One MAC receiving most traffic

Key filters:

arp
eth.src == <suspicious_mac>
eth.dst == <suspicious_mac>

🔐 Credential sniffing (HTTP)

Focus on:

POST requests

application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Filters:

http.request.method == POST
urlencoded-form contains "user"
urlencoded-form contains "pass"

🧬 Host & user identification

Use protocol metadata:

DHCP → hostname

NBNS → workstation names

Kerberos → users & hosts

Examples:

dhcp.option.hostname
nbns.name
kerberos.CNameString

🚨 DNS / ICMP tunneling

What matters:

Long subdomains

High volume

Encoded-looking strings

DNS:

dns and strlen(dns.qry.name) > 50


ICMP:

Large payloads

Repeating ICMP traffic after execution

Analyst mindset (this matters more than filters)

Ask yourself:

Is this normal behavior for this protocol?

Is there volume, repetition, or odd structure?

Does it happen after another suspicious event?
